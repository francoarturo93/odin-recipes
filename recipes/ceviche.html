    <ol>
        <li>The first thing you must do to be able to prepare the easy Peruvian ceviche recipe is to squeeze the 12 lemons to extract their juice, save it for later. Then, cut the fish into pieces of approximately 3 centimeters. Place the pieces in the container that you will use to serve the dish.</li>
        <li>Mix the fish with the chopped yellow pepper, the fish broth and the coriander. Also place the onion cut into julianas and the crushed garlic. Let it rest for a few minutes so that it marinates well and soaks up all the flavors.</li>
        <li>Season to taste and place the boiled sweet potato, lettuce and sweet corn, also boiled, on one side of the plate.</li>
        <li>Then, pour the lemon juice all over the plate so that everything is well covered. Finally, cut a slice of red chili pepper and place it as a decoration. Reserve it in the refrigerator to cool, since this is a dish that is served cold. Peruvian ceviche is a dish that acts as an appetizer, so you can accompany it with rice with shrimp or a delicious salmon with shrimp sauce. Ready to eat!</li>
